A rundown of how the Sequence works: 
- The basic idea is subract if you can and its a new value (go back), otherwise add (go forward) 
- Mathematicaly the seq is defined as 
       
        (n-1)-n if (n-1)-n > 0 and is new, ie not already in the seq 
a(n) = 
        n-1 + n otherwise,
       
- The first ten terms in the recaman seq are:
    1 3 6 2 7 13 20 12 21 11 22  ï¿¼

Visualizing the recaman seq: 
- To visualize we draw a semi circle between the current value n, in the seq, and the next value, n+1 
- The radius of a given semi circle is the distance between n+1 and n divided by 2 
- If the distance between the two values in the seq are postive (we are going foward) the semi circle will be located in the postive plane 
- Else the distance is negative and we are going back, then the semi circle is located in the negative xy plane 
- We shift each semi circle by current distance traveled, or the current value in the seq
